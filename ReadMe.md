## Disease Prediction Website

A website to help the people who are ill and having some serious symptoms. Initially, when a user (patient) registers himself, he/she will be required to enter symptoms. After entering the symptoms, the predicted disease will be shown.

AFter the prediction of disease, a list of home remedies related to that disease will be shown. If the user chooses not to follow the remedies, the user can proceed to book an appointment with the doctor. The doctor will then scgedule the appointment, when the patient pays the fees of that particular doctor.

For the prediction model, the .py file of the ML model is integrated into the website by the process of pickling.

List of all the Python and ML libraries used:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
